    "## Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that helps computers learn from data without being directly programmed with fixed rules. In traditional programming, we give the computer clear instructions (rules) and input data, and it produces an output. But in Machine Learning, we provide the computer with data and the correct answers (examples), and it automatically finds patterns and learns the rules on its own. Once trained, the system can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. For example, instead of writing rules to identify spam emails, we give the computer many examples of spam and non-spam emails, and it learns how to distinguish them. In simple words, Machine Learning allows computers to improve their performance through experience and data.\n"

    "## 1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the dataset contains input data along with the correct output labels. \n",
    "The model learns by mapping inputs to outputs and minimizing the error between predicted and actual values. \n",
    "It is mainly used for classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the dataset does not contain labels. \n",
    "The model tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or clusters in the data without any predefined answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of learning where an agent interacts with an environment and learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. \n",
    "The goal is to maximize the total reward over time.\n",

    "## Why Choosing the Correct Type Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the wrong learning type can make your model fail before development begins. \n",
    "If you use supervised learning without labeled data, the model cannot learn correctly. \n",
    "If you use unsupervised learning when prediction is required, it will not provide accurate outputs. \n",
    "Reinforcement learning is suitable only when learning happens through interaction and rewards."
